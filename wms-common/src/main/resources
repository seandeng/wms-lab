The /wms-lab/wms-lab/wms-common/src/main/resources directory is intended to hold resource files such as configuration files and property files for the common module. Since you have not specified any particular resource files to include, I will create a placeholder file named `application.properties` that can be used for configuration settings.

Here are the contents for the file:

# application.properties
# This file is intentionally left blank. You can add your configuration properties here.
