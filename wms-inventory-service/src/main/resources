The directory `/wms-lab/wms-lab/wms-inventory-service/src/main/resources` is intended to hold resource files for the inventory service module. Since you have not specified any particular resource files to include, I will create a basic `application.properties` file, which is commonly used in Spring Boot applications for configuration.

Here are the contents for the file `/wms-lab/wms-lab/wms-inventory-service/src/main/resources/application.properties`:

# application.properties
# This file is intentionally left blank.
